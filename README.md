## Overview

A command line interface (CLI) is an alternative way than what you're probably used to of interacting with your computers operating system and some software you've installed. Normally you interact with your computer by using its graphical user interface (GUI), which is a more modern invention than the CLI.

A CLI is used by typing a series of commands for your machine to execute. You can use a CLI without a mouse. By contrast a GUI is visiually driven with things like icons and menus that you can click on. A CLI typically has a steeper learning curve than a GUI, which is built to be very user friendly.

Developers us lot of things, but mostly running their projects or project unit tests

## First Commands to Learn

### cd

_change directory_

### ls

_list_

### git

See the Basics of Using Git

### node

## How to Guide

For this section I'll assume that you're using the default Terminal application running bash as it's shell. You can see some [alternative](#Alternatives) setups below. I'd recommend trying iTerm2 and fish once you feel comfortable on the command line. You can open ther Terminal application through Mac's Spotlight feature by typing "Terminal" and selecting the first option.

`man` is a command that can come in handy when you aren't sure about how something works. Typing `man <some other command>` will print the documentation for that command to your terminal. To escape the documentation you can type `:wq` and hit enter.

## Alternatives (optional)

Neither of the following lists are all encompassing. Mac's come with solid defualt terminal application and shell, but there are alternatives.

### Terminal Applications

The actual application you open on your computer.

* Terminal: Default terminal application that comes preinstalled on Macs 
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/): Alternative terminal application that can be intstalled with some more advanced features

### Shell

The interpreter that parses and processes your commands.

* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
* [zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)
